# Wargames

These are some of the notes I have made playing [Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) from OverTheWire. This is meant to track my progress and review previous steps, not to be a guide for players.

These exercises are a great way to keep up my skills in `bash` and various `Unix` commands.

## Progress

| Wargame                                                  | Current Level        | Solutions Used |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Bandit                                                   | Level 14 (out of 34) |                |
| [Leviathan](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/) | Level 1 (out of 7)   |                |

### Solutions Used

Looking up how a command is used or how to complete a task in Unix is not considered using a solution. Part of the challenge is learning how to use available resources to solve a given task, so it's valid to look up how to run certain commands.

Using a solution only occurs when I look up how to do the bandit problem specifically. This includes times when I lookup how to start approaching a particular bandit program.

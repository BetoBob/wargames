# Wargames

These are some of the notes I have made playing [Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) from OverTheWire. This is meant to track my progress and review previous steps, not to be a guide for players.

These exercises are a great way to keep up my skills in `bash` and various `Unix` commands.

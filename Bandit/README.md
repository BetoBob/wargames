# [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

## Setup

Go to Bandit directory in PowerShell. Open the Github folder and type `powershell` in the address bar to start a session in the working directory.

PowerShell will be used because it has more features then command prompt. A big missing feature in command prompt is command history, which is especially helpful when commands are repeated, like the `ssh` command with the server address.

It also is optimal because it has less overhead than working in the Linux subsystem. If necessary, I can switch to a subsystem environment from PowerShell running the `bash` command. 

## Resources

Below is a good set of solutions explaining how to approach these problems:

Even if I find a solution, it might be good to look up solutions occasionally to see if there was a more intuitive way to approach my problem.

## Level 0

* needed to take port number into account when using SSH
* https://superuser.com/questions/1536983/stuck-in-bandit-level-0-overthewire-org

```

## Level 5 -> Level 6

* **note:** remember to look for *all* files (including hidden files)
* **note:** in the future probably better to just use the `find` command (more proper and probably faster)
* I looked up the solution for this one

## [Level 12 -> Level 13](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit13.html)

* storing files in directory `/tmp/beto/`
  * you can change to this directory to easily do work in it
* I used [this blog post](https://dynamicparallax.wordpress.com/2015/09/22/bandit-level-12-%E2%86%92-level-13/) to help me understand how to work backwards in the decompression
  * used it on the first decompression step, then used the `man` pages for future steps

**Steps**

1. Reverse Hex (only once; because this occurred after all the compression)
   * use `xxd -r` to achieve this
2. Reverse Compression several times

Reversing the hex is pretty easy. The trick is doing backwards compression on the files. In order to do this, you must know how the file is compressed because there are several compression algorithms. So here is the way to loop backwards through the compression:

1. do `file data` to check which tool was used to compress the file last
2. read the `man` page of the file to learn how to decompress a file
3. change the `data` file name if necessary for the compression tool
   * **example**: `gzip` requires the `.gz` file extension (use `mv` to rename the file appropriately)
4. run the correct decompress algorithm and continue to the next one

This involved several steps, so I am only going to show some sample commands I ran. The first snippet was using `file` command on the first data file I changed. This was after running `xxd -r` to reverse the hexdump of the file:

```bash
bandit12@bandit:~$ file /tmp/beto/data1.txt
/tmp/beto/data1.txt: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix
```

So for this first set of de-compression, I had to rename `data1.txt` to `data1.gz`, then I ran the command `gzip -d data1.gz` to unzip the file.

I did this for several other compression types including `gzip`, `gzip2`, `tar` and `bzip`. After doing this several times and learning the proper decompression flags to run for these commands, I finally got the password:

```bash
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/beto$ file data8.gz
data8.gz: gzip compressed data, was "data9.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/beto$ gzip -d data8.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/beto$ cat data8
The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL
```

**Level 13 Password**

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

I literally copied this to my local machine in a file text file and renamed it `sshkey.private` (stored in directory `14`). Then I ran this command to access the next server:

```bash
ssh -i 14/sshkey.private -p 2220 bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
```

* [Log in with an SSH private key](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/logging-in-with-an-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)

* I'm sure there could have been a way to download a copy of the SSH key, but I'm lazy
  * copying the text worked just fine

## [Level 14 -> Level 15](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit15.html)

Login with this command:

```bash
ssh -i 14/sshkey.private -p 2220 bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
```

* changing the `-p` flag to `30000` does not resolve this issue

First, I need to find the password of the current server I am in. I currently only have the SSH key for the server I am in, not the actual password itself.

I had to look up how to find the password for each level. Initially I thought I had to use a `sudo` command to check my user's password info. However in the README of the servers, it states that each game's password is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass`:

```
--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.
```

```bash
bandit14@bandit:~$ ls -l /etc/bandit_pass/
total 136
-r-------- 1 bandit0  bandit0   8 May  7  2020 bandit0
-r-------- 1 bandit1  bandit1  33 May  7  2020 bandit1
-r-------- 1 bandit10 bandit10 33 May  7  2020 bandit10
-r-------- 1 bandit11 bandit11 33 May  7  2020 bandit11
-r-------- 1 bandit12 bandit12 33 May  7  2020 bandit12
-r-------- 1 bandit13 bandit13 33 May  7  2020 bandit13
-r-------- 1 bandit14 bandit14 33 May  7  2020 bandit14
-r-------- 1 bandit15 bandit15 33 May  7  2020 bandit15
...
```

```bash
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
```

So now that I have that password, I just need to submit it to 30000 from the localhost of `bandit14`:

```bash
bandit14@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30000
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
Correct!
BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
```

The tool [`nc` (short for `netcat`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) is used to read and write to network ports using TCP or UDP. The command literally just opens up the localhost 30000 for listening, then you send the password through standard input. This will definitely be a tool I will want to learn in the future. As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) says:

> **netcat** (often abbreviated to **nc**) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) or [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol). The [command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing)) is designed to be a dependable [back-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and  scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and  investigation tool, since it can produce almost any kind of connection  its user could need and has a number of built-in capabilities.
>
> Its list of features includes port scanning, transferring files, and port listening: as with any server, it can be used as a [backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)).

* I had to look up the solution for this challenge

## [Level 15 -> Level 16](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit16.html)

Because this seemed a lot like the previous question, I looked up how to use `nc` with SSL encryption.

I found a [StackExchange post](https://serverfault.com/questions/476068/can-netcat-talk-to-an-encrypted-port) about using `nc` to access a port with SSL, and they recommended to use `openssl` instead. So I configured the command in the StackExchange post to use `localhost` on port `30001`, and got the solution I was looking for:

```bash
bandit15@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
CONNECTED(00000003)
depth=0 CN = localhost
verify error:num=18:self signed certificate

A brief description of OpenSSL from the man pages:

> OpenSSL is a cryptography toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) network protocols and related cryptography standards required by them. The openssl program is a command line tool for using the various cryptography functions of OpenSSL's crypto library from the shell.

According to the video above, SSL is what makes the 's' in `https` secure. `https` is secure in two ways:

1. data encryption, so only the client and server share information (no intercepted data); this encryption method is **SSL**
2. certificates, issued by a certificate authority to verify if a website is what it claims to be
   * these certificates can be verified by several different authorities (ex: Google Trust Services LLC,  [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) (a TLS certificate nonprofit), Cloudflare)
     * typically big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple have their own certification services for their websites
